    Direct-writing is an additive manufacturing process where polymer resins are extruded and functional geometries/patterns are fabricated to produce specialized products. This is similar to the FDM (fused deposition method) but differs in the process of curing/solidification. For the direct write process, the solidification is achieved by UV ray curing.

    <br>
    Modeling of this additive manufacturing process is helpful to optimize its process parameters to achieve desired dimensional accuracy consistently.
