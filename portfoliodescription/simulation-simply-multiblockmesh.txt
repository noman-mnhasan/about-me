        <b>simply multiBlockMesh</b> : A "blockMeshDict" generator script for complex multi-block mesh generation using blockMesh. &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/noman-mnhasan/simply_multiBlockMesh" target="_blank" ><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square anchor-icon"></i></a>

        <br>
        The "simply multiBlockMesh" script generates a formatted (with proper identification indexes) <b>blockMeshDict</b> consisting large number of blocks, as well as additional mesh and block information to create complex mesh for CFD analysis. It's suitable for developing mesh of simplified geometry for faster model development with <b>all hex</b> mesh elements.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <hr>
    <div id="simulation-simply_multiblockmesh-motivation" class="description text-justified">
        There are several powerful mesh generation tool available in OpenFOAM and blockMesh is one of them. Meshing tool like "snappyHexMesh" are more popular with users for its ability to create mesh with complex geometry because of its ease of use. On the other hand, "blockMesh" requires meticulous effort to generate mesh that represents geometries  much simpler. Al though its tedious to generate mesh using blockMesh, its ability to generate <b>high quality hex mesh</b> is highly sought after. The <b>simply multiBlockMesh</b> script allows the user to develop mesh using "blockMesh" by taking care of the meticulous nature of mesh definitions and it allows the user to define as many blocks as teh user needs - which become very difficult and error-prone while doing manually.

    <h2>Contribution</h2>

    <div id="simulation-simply_multiblockmesh-contribution" class="description text-justified">
        The "simply multiBlockMesh" tool is a simple script to help OpenFOAM users develop the blockMesh dictionary, iteratively. Each iteration helps users to transform a simple "brick-like" mesh into a mesh that resembles the real-world problem the user is trying to simulate.
        <br>
        <br>
        The "simply multiBlockMesh" tool is written in python and comes with a simple shell scripts where the user needs to provide the mesh specifications. Once the specs are defined, the "simply multiBlockMesh" tool generates the dictionary for blockMesh and the user can run the blockMesh utility to generate the mesh.

    <h2>Impact</h2>

    <div id="simulation-multiInterfaceDyMFoam-impact" class="description text-justified">
        One of the benefits of generating mesh using blockMesh is - the generated mesh is highly compatible with using OpenFOAM's dynamic mesh refinement utility. Using the dynamic mesh refinement  (leveraging <b>dynamicRefineFvMesh</b> utility) often faces challenges with mesh generated by the "snappyHexMesh" meshing tool because of the different level of mesh refinement already existing from the "snappyHex" process. Therefore, the ability to create high quality hex mesh along with the compatibility with dynamic mesh refinement, makes blockMesh a powerful. The purpose behind the "simply multiBlockMesh" tool is provide a helping hand to create mesh using the "blockMesh" utility with much ease.

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <div id="simulation-multiInterfaceDyMFoam-example" class="description text-justified">
        Using the "simply multiBlockMesh" tool, a simplified case for oil water separator has been developed. The computational domain is significantly reduced for faster simulation. The mesh created for this oil-water separator is overly simplified. The case setup was fast, and aimed for a proof-of-concept demonstration.

        <b>NOTE:</b> The test case is run using the custom OpenFOAM solver multiInterfaceDyMFoam <i>(check the portfolio section)</i> which allows the dynamic mesh refinement to be implemented at multiple interfaces, without having the refine the cells containing a single phase. This feature is not available in the standard multiphaseInterFoam solver. The dynamic mesh refinement is achieved by the dynamicRefineFvMesh option in the constant/dynamicMeshDict. The simulation can easily be run using the multiphaseInterFoam solver without the high resolution interface tracking.
